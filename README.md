# Soup TUI
A basic Python package for text UI with input validation, progress bars, and tables (upcoming).

**IMPORTANT:** When using this package, always use `soup_tui.print` and `soup_tui.input` instead of the `print` and `input` builtins. Example:
```
import soup_tui as tui

# This is fine
tui.print('Hello World!')

# Don't do this; it can mess with some features
# print('Hello World!')
```
